## Workshop Progression

This workshop follows a natural progression that mirrors how organizations typically evolve their AI strategy:

1. **Understanding the Business Case and Foundation (Day 1)**
   * Analysis of business drivers, challenges, and AI use cases
   * Design of secure, scalable Azure foundation using Landing Zone principles
   * Establishment of governance, security, and operational controls

2. **Implementing a Specific AI Workload (Day 2 Morning)**
   * Design of a RAG chatbot to address a specific business need
   * Selection of appropriate Azure services and architectural patterns
   * Integration with the landing zone environment

3. **Scaling to Enterprise-wide AI (Day 2 Afternoon)**
   * Leveraging lessons from initial implementation to design a centralized AI Hub
   * Addressing governance, security, and scaling concerns for multiple workloads
   * Establishing patterns for enterprise-wide AI adoption

This structured approach ensures participants gain practical experience with the complete lifecycle of AI solution architecture, from foundation to specific workload to enterprise scaling.

## Step 4: Present and Justify (1 hour)

**Activity:** Prepare a high-level diagram of your proposed architecture, highlighting how it addresses the core requirements and challenges.

**Outcome:** Briefly present your design, explaining:
* The overall AI strategy for IFS.
* The Landing Zone structure (Platform and Application).
* The networking design and how it supports secure, private connectivity.
* The resource organization design, including the hierarchy and naming conventions.
* How your design meets key requirements like security, governance, scalability, and compliance.
* Key Azure services used in each major component.

**Success Criteria:**
By the end of this step, participants should be able to:
- Present a clear, high-level architecture diagram showing the Platform Landing Zone, Application Landing Zone(s), and key networking components (Hub, Spokes, connectivity).
- Verbally articulate the purpose and structure of the design recommendations for Management Groups, Subscriptions, and other resources.
- Explain how **at least three** specific requirements from Step 2 (covering different areas like security, governance, connectivity) are addressed by their design, referencing specific architectural components or Azure services.
- Justify the selection of **at least three** key Azure services used in their design, explaining why they were chosen over alternatives in the context of IFS's needs.
- Demonstrate how the design adheres to core Landing Zone principles (e.g., policy-driven governance, private networking, separation of duties).
- Clearly link specific design decisions back to IFS's business objectives (e.g., cost reduction, innovation speed) or regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI DSS).

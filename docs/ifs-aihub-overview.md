# Challenge-Based Whiteboard Design Session: Centralized & Secure AI Service Hub

**Session Goal:** Design a dedicated, secure "AI Hub" environment to host and manage shared Azure AI services (like Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search) and orchestration logic. This hub must act as the single, controlled gateway for accessing these services, enforcing strict security and governance, with a focus on private networking and complete isolation.

This challenge focuses on creating a robust AI service management layer that enables IFS to securely adopt and govern AI services across their organization while maintaining complete control over access, security, and compliance.

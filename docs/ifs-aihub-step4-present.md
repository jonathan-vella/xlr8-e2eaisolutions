## Step 4: Present and Justify (30 minutes)

**Activity:** Prepare a high-level diagram of your proposed AI Hub architecture that demonstrates how it builds upon and scales the approach used in the RAG chatbot implementation.

**Outcome:** Briefly present your design, explaining:
* The key components and chosen Azure services for the AI Hub
* How the architecture addresses the limitations identified in the RAG chatbot implementation
* How the hub provides secure, private access to AI services for multiple departments and applications
* The implementation of the secure gateway/entry point and how it scales to handle multiple workloads
* How the design ensures proper monitoring, governance, and cost management across different business units
* The networking design that connects the AI Hub to multiple application landing zones
* The rationale behind key design decisions and how they address IFS's enterprise-wide AI adoption requirements

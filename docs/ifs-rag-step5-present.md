## Step 5: Present and Justify (30 minutes)

**Activity:** Prepare a high-level diagram of your proposed workload architecture.

**Outcome:** Briefly present your design, explaining:
* The key components and chosen Azure services.
* The selected hosting option for the prompt flow backend and the rationale.
* How the application integrates securely within the Landing Zone network and interacts with AI services privately.
* How security, monitoring, and deployment requirements are met.

**Note for Further Evolution:**
While this RAG chatbot implementation meets the current requirements, the team should consider what limitations this approach might have as IFS scales to multiple AI workloads across different departments. This initial implementation will provide valuable insights that can inform the creation of a more centralized AI Hub in the future.

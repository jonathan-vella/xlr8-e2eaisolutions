## Step 4:  (1 hour)

**Desired Outcome**

In this collaborative challenge, your team will design an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution. Using [Microsoft’s baseline OpenAI chat architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/baseline-openai-e2e-chat) as inspiration, you’ll plan a system where a user interface, knowledge retrieval service, and AI language model interact seamlessly.

Your goal is to integrate this solution into a secure, scalable Azure Landing Zone environment in alignment with [Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Landing Zone architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/azure-openai-baseline-landing-zone). The final design should be production-ready, with built-in governance, security, and operational practices.

**The Challenge**

Design a real-world, enterprise-ready RAG application and demonstrate how it will operate within Azure Landing Zones. Your solution should:

- Define key architectural components (UI, orchestration, retrieval, LLM backend)
- Integrate with Azure Landing Zones using secure and governed practices
- Emphasize identity, networking, compliance, and operational readiness

This is your opportunity to show how a powerful AI solution can be securely deployed, governed, and scaled in the cloud—just like it would be in a production scenario.

**Success Criteria:**

Your team will have succeeded when you can present:

- **Architecture Design:** A clear breakdown of your RAG solution’s components and how they work together.
- **Landing Zone Integration:** A deployment plan showing how each component fits into the Azure Landing Zone, including networking, identity, and policy considerations.
- **Security and Governance:** A description of how you’ll secure data flows, manage secrets, and enforce governance using Azure-native tools.
- **Validation Strategy:** An outline of how you’ll test and validate your solution (e.g., functional, security, and performance testing).

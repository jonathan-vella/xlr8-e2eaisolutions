## Step 4: Integrate the Workload in the Customer's Landing Zone Environment (1 hour)

**Activity:** Work as a team to integrate the "IFS Knowledge Assistant" workload into the customer's Azure Landing Zone environment. This step focuses on making the workload production-ready by addressing networking, security, compliance, and operational requirements.

**Outcome:** Attendees will answer key integration questions, ensuring the workload is fully operational within the Landing Zone while adhering to IFS's governance policies.

**Challenge Questions:**

1. **Networking Integration:**
    * How will you ensure that all workload components (UI, backend, dependencies) are securely integrated into the Landing Zone Virtual Network (VNet)?
    * What steps are required to configure private endpoints or VNet integration for services like Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI, and Key Vault?
    * How will you verify DNS resolution for private endpoints to ensure seamless communication between components?

2. **Identity and Access Management:**
    * How will you assign Managed Identities to application components (UI, backend) to securely access Azure resources?
    * What role-based access control (RBAC) configurations are needed to enforce least-privilege access for each component?

3. **Secrets Management:**
    * Where will you store sensitive information (e.g., connection strings, API keys) to ensure secure access at runtime?
    * How will application components retrieve secrets securely using Managed Identities?

4. **Security and Compliance:**
    * How will you validate that all communication between components and Azure services occurs over private network connections?
    * What steps will you take to ensure compliance with IFS's security policies, including encryption in transit and at rest?
    * How will you conduct a security review to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities?

5. **Monitoring and Observability:**
    * What Azure Monitor components (e.g., Application Insights, Log Analytics) will you use to monitor the workload?
    * What critical metrics and alerts will you define to ensure the workload operates reliably in production?

6. **Scalability and Reliability:**
    * How will you configure autoscaling for hosting services (e.g., App Service, Container Apps) to handle varying workloads?
    * What measures will you implement to ensure high availability, such as zone redundancy for critical components?

7. **Deployment Readiness:**
    * How will you validate the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates (e.g., Bicep/Terraform) for deploying the workload in the Landing Zone?
    * What steps will you take to test the CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment of application updates?


### Deliverables:

1. **Integration Plan:** A detailed plan outlining how the workload components will be integrated into the Landing Zone.
2. **Updated Architecture Diagram:** A diagram showing the integrated workload, including networking, security, and dependencies.
3. **Validation Checklist:** A checklist summarizing the results of integration tests, including network connectivity, security compliance, and performance benchmarks.


### Key Considerations:

* How will you ensure that all workload components adhere to IFS's Landing Zone governance policies?
* What steps will you take to validate that the workload can scale and operate reliably in production?
* How will you confirm that monitoring and alerting configurations are in place to support ongoing operations?

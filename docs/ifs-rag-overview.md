# Challenge-Based Whiteboard Design Session: IFS Knowledge Assistant Chatbot Workload

**Session Goal:** Design the architecture for a secure, internal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot application ("IFS Knowledge Assistant") for Innovate Financial Services (IFS) employees, based on the principles of the Azure OpenAI End-to-End Chat baseline. This includes selecting hosting options, ensuring security, and planning for deployment within IFS's established Azure Landing Zone environment.

**Assumed Context:** IFS has already established an Azure Landing Zone foundation, including network connectivity, identity management, and basic security controls that should be leveraged for this workload.

## Step 1: Understand the Customer (30 minutes)

**Activity:** Review the [Innovate Financial Services Customer Story](./ifs-customer-story.md).

**Outcome:** As a team, discuss and answer the following based *only* on the customer story:

1.  **Why does IFS want to use Azure for AI, and what are their primary use cases for AI?**
    * *Hint: Consider their market pressures, strategic goals, and specific financial service applications mentioned.*
2.  **What are IFS's core business objectives driving this transformation?**
    * *Hint: Focus on the desired outcomes related to fraud, customer experience, costs, and innovation speed.*
3.  **How will IFS measure the success of this initiative?**
    * *Hint: Identify the specific metrics and KPIs mentioned in the story.*

> **Note:**
> The customer story is intentionally high-level. The goal is to extract the key business drivers and objectives that will inform your design decisions. A mission statement helps you align your objectives and key results to your organization's overall business mission. To help you derive a statement for their business, consider these initial questions:

> - Why are they exploring to use Azure and AI? Where do they want to be in the future? When do they want to achieve this?
> - What are their mandatory business objectives? And what are their nice-to-have objectives?
> - What is your "definition of done"?
> - What are the key metrics that will be used to measure success?
> - What are the KPIs that will be used to measure success?

Use the answers to these questions to help define the customer's mission statement for their AI adoption cloud strategy. For example:

> *"IFS will leverage Azure and AI to transform their financial services, enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency while ensuring compliance and security. Their goal is to innovate rapidly, reduce costs, and deliver high-quality services that meet the evolving needs of their customers."*

**Success Criteria:**  
By the end of this step, participants should be able to clearly articulate:
- The main business drivers and objectives for IFS's AI adoption.
- The specific AI use cases IFS is targeting.
- The measurable success metrics and KPIs that will be used to evaluate the initiative (e.g., reduction in fraud, improved customer satisfaction, cost savings, faster AI deployment cycles).
- A draft mission statement summarizing IFS's AI transformation goals.

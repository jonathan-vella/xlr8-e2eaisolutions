## Step 1: Define the Scenario (15 minutes)

**Scenario:**
After successfully implementing the RAG chatbot for internal knowledge management, Innovate Financial Services (IFS) has recognized the broader potential of AI services across the organization. However, the implementation also highlighted several challenges:

1. The current approach of deploying AI services directly into application landing zones would become difficult to manage and govern as more departments request AI capabilities
2. Security, compliance, and cost controls need to be centralized and standardized
3. Multiple teams are now requesting access to AI services, but with varying requirements
4. The expertise gained from the RAG chatbot implementation should be leveraged to create a more scalable solution

To address these emerging needs, IFS has decided to build a dedicated "AI Hub" that will host shared Azure AI services (including Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and potentially other AI-related services). This hub will serve as the centralized point for deploying, managing, and accessing AI services across the organization, building upon the lessons learned from the initial RAG chatbot implementation.

**Activity:** Discuss the core components required for a Centralized & Secure AI Service Hub. What high-level architectural elements, security considerations, and governance mechanisms are needed based on the experience gained from the RAG chatbot implementation?

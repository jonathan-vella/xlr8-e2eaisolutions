# ✅ How to Integrate AI Governance & Content Safety in Each Section

## 🔷 1. Component Breakdown
**Goal:** Ensure governance components are identified as part of core system architecture.

**Add Question:**
- “Where do AI governance and content safety components reside in our architecture? Should they be part of the orchestration layer or a separate policy enforcement layer?”

**Checklist References:**
- Use tools like Defender for Cloud to discover AI workload risks.
- Use standards (ISO/IEC 23053:2022) for auditing.


## 🔷 2. UI (User Interface)
**Add Question:**
- “How do we ensure that users' inputs to the UI are not malicious or unpredictable, and how do we sanitize prompts?”

**Checklist References:**
- Implement threat protection for all AI models.
- Use Azure AI Content Safety to define content filters for user inputs.



## 🔷 3. Backend Orchestration (Prompt Flow Logic)
**Add Questions:**
- “How do we use Azure AI Content Safety or similar tools to validate prompt and response content before returning it to the user?”
- “Can we add metadata tags or classifiers to log harmful or unsafe interactions?”

**Checklist References:**
- Enable recommended alert rules for workload health.
- Use content filtering systems like Azure AI Content Safety.



## 🔷 4. Hosting (Managed Endpoint vs Containers)
**Add Governance Discussion Point:**
- “Does our hosting environment allow us to integrate with governance tools like Azure Policy, Defender for Cloud, or AI content safety plugins?”

**Checklist References:**
- Maintain inventory of AI workloads.
- Use secure coding practices to prevent injection attacks.



## 🔷 5. Data Flow & RAG
**Add Question:**
- “How do we ensure the documents retrieved and the final AI response comply with data sensitivity and content safety standards?”

**Checklist References:**
- Use encryption at rest (e.g., BYOK).
- Safeguard sensitive data via role-based access control and anonymization.



## 🔷 6. Security & Identity
**Add Question:**
- “Do we use Azure AI Content Safety to filter out inappropriate AI responses before displaying them to the user?”
- “Are identity and role-based access enforced for embeddings and vector search?”

**Checklist References:**
- Apply RBAC to data stores containing embeddings.
- Use Managed Identities for secure component access.



## 🔷 7. Networking
**Add Compliance Check:**
- “Do our private endpoints and firewalls also protect against unauthorized AI workload access?”
- “Are content moderation and logging components deployed in the same secure VNet?”

**Checklist References:**
- Enforce TLS for all data in transit.
- Use content filtering at the edge (via Azure AI Content Safety API or app gateway WAF).



## 🔷 8. Monitoring & Observability
**Add Question:**
- “What AI-specific logs (e.g., prompt/response audit trail, content safety violations) should be sent to Log Analytics or App Insights?”

**Checklist References:**
- Enable diagnostics logs for all AI services.
- Evaluate performance and safety accuracy of LLM outputs.



## 🔷 9. Deployment (IaC & CI/CD)
**Add Question:**
- “Are we validating AI model configurations and safety filters as part of the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using pf CLI or custom tests)?”

**Checklist References:**
- Setup patching processes for LLM libraries.
- Automate verification mechanisms to validate prompt safety policies.

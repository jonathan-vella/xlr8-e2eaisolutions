# Azure AI Best Practices Summary

## DevOps
- Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments and ensure consistent, repeatable releases.
- Leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Azure Bicep, ARM Templates, or Terraform to manage your Azure AI Landing Zone.
- Include unit tests for both infrastructure and application code as part of your build process to maintain quality.
- Use declarative IaC to maintain your environments and enable rapid, reliable changes.

## Data Classification
- Establish a version control process for grounding data, especially in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios.
- Ensure all data ingested into AI models is classified and vetted according to centralized standards.
- Use unified data catalog and classification tools like Microsoft Purview to maintain consistency and compliance.
- Apply content filtering systems, such as Azure AI Content Safety, to detect and prevent the use of sensitive or copyrighted material in AI workloads.

## Cost Management
- Monitor and optimize resource usage by configuring 'Actual' and 'Forecasted' budget alerts.
- Select cost-effective models and deployment types, and allocate provisioning quotas for each model based on expected workloads.
- Use prompt compression tools (e.g., LLMLingua, gprtrim) and batching to reduce costs.
- Set maximum token limits, evaluate billing models (PAYG vs PTU), and enforce policies for automatic shutdown of unused resources.
- Remove unused fine-tuned models to avoid ongoing hosting fees, and use cost tracking systems to inform model and prompt choices.

## Security
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit using Azure's built-in encryption features and enforce RBAC for access control.
- Use managed identities instead of API keys for authentication.
- Store and manage keys securely in Azure Key Vault, and regularly rotate and expire keys.
- Follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities, enable diagnostic logging, and adhere to the Azure Security Baseline for AI services.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, and implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication.

## Monitoring
- Enable comprehensive monitoring and logging for all AI workloads.
- Set up alerts for anomalies and use Azure Monitor to track KPIs and resource health.
- Proactively identify and address performance bottlenecks, and ensure diagnostic logs are enabled for troubleshooting and performance analysis.
- Use tools like Defender for Cloud to discover AI workloads and explore risks, and implement a monitoring system to ensure alignment with business KPIs.

## BCDR (Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery)
- Deploy AI workloads across multiple regions to ensure high availability and resiliency.
- Implement failover and retry policies, and regularly back up critical data using Azure's backup and disaster recovery services.
- Use multi-region API gateways (e.g., APIM + Azure Front Door) for high availability and disaster recovery, and ensure adequate quotas for resiliency.
- Deploy separate fine-tuned models across regions if finetuning is employed, and ensure your AI search service tiers have an SLA.

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain a detailed and up-to-date inventory of your AI workload resources.
- Regularly evaluate risks using frameworks like MITRE ATLAS, OWASP Machine Learning risk, and OWASP Generative AI risk.
- Conduct red-team testing against generative and non-generative models to assess vulnerabilities.
- Develop and maintain incident response plans, enforce customer-managed keys for data at rest, and provide AI-focused employee training and awareness.

## Access Management & Authentication
- Eliminate static API keys in favor of Microsoft Entra ID for authentication.
- Enforce multi-factor authentication and use Azure RBAC to manage data plane access to resources.
- Periodically review entitlements using Entra ID PIM access reviews, and require clients to authenticate using Entra ID when accessing AI model endpoints.
- Disable key-based access where possible to enforce minimum privilege and granular control.

## Networking
- Isolate AI resources within VNets to enhance security and control traffic flow.
- Use private endpoints to connect securely to AI services, reducing exposure to the public internet.
- Restrict network access to only approved outbound modes, and deploy API gateways for load balancing, rate limiting, and secure connectivity.
- Configure data loss prevention for Azure AI services and limit outbound traffic from AI resources.

## Data Protection & Privacy
- Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit, and use RBAC to restrict access to sensitive data.
- Ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA by implementing privacy controls and obtaining necessary consents.
- Establish data retention and disposal policies, and use masking or redaction techniques for sensitive data in non-production environments.
- Classify data and sensitivity before generating embeddings, and treat embeddings with the same sensitivity as the source data.

## Operations
- Use dynamic sessions in Azure Container Apps to ensure each code execution occurs in a fresh, isolated environment.
- Set resource limits (CPU, memory, disk usage) for code execution environments to prevent excessive resource consumption.
- Implement a monitoring system to ensure AI workloads remain aligned with KPIs, and proactively identify performance bottlenecks and anomalies.
- Standardize compute management, enable resource locks, and automate model promotion and retraining based on performance or business needs.
